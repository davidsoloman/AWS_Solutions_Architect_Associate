## AWS: Platform & Services
AWS cloud platform can be categorized broadly into three main models for cloud computing:
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): It provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space.
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): It helps organizations to be more efficient as they don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running their application.
3. Software as a Service (SaaS): It provide a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. User do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how user will use that particular piece software.

All the services offered by AWS fall in one of the above categories. Below are are set of different services that are provided by AWS:

### Infrastructure Services:
AWS infra is split into Regions and Availability Zones

Regions(R): A geographic area where AWS resources exist, currently 15. Each R contains 2 or more AZ and these AZ provide the services

Availability Zones(AZ): A physical data center, nearly 35

Edge Location: A content delivery network, that can be used to cache the data/content for user. It is the CDN endpoint for AWS Cloudfront. There are nearly 66 Edge Location

#### VPC: 
It is a virtual Data Center in all the regions, multiple VPC / region.
Note: Very Important

#### Route 53:  
Amazon DNS service, Route + 53< here 53 is DNS port> and route is after route 66

#### Cloud Front: 
Caching and CDN service for large files and media services

#### Direct Connect: Dedicated line connection, this service is not used to reduce reliability on Internet

#### EC2 / Elastic Compute Cloud: 
This is virtual machine on AWS, provide compute resources
EC2 Container Service (ECS) - Its basically a docker instance

#### EBS / Elastic Bean Stalk: 
this is used to deploy and manage applications and code to AWS. 
EBS will review the application and automatically detect deployment requirements, autoscaling, load balancing, health monitoring.
Use other services such as EC2, S3, ELB,  Autoscaling to deliver highly reliable, scalable and cost-effective infrastructure
AWS cloud watch can be used to monitor the status and health and requirements of the application.

#### Lambda: 
Allow to run application without need of a Server.
The code is run whenever there is new data, or a new trigger for code. no charges for ideal time
Good for real time data processing.
Good for Not, mobile or Web apps
Benefits: No server to manage or maintain, pay per use, no charge for idle time
Trigger for Lambda can be generated by either kinesis, S3, Simple Notification Service, DynamoDB to trigger Lambda operation. This is due to any incoming load or change in the state
Charging - Every 100ms code runs, or every trigger for the code.

#### Light sail: 
Allow users to deploy basic websites on Joomla or Wordpress if they do not have much experience with AWS


### Storage Services
Has  4 components - 

#### S3 / Simple Storage Service :
Used to store objects on cloud 

#### Glacier:

Store these files for long time, extremely low cost.
Very slow retrieval time <3-4 hr>

#### AFS / Elastic File System:
This is Block based service
This can be shared between different systems on EC2 which can access the file simultaneously and update it.
Similar to Google sheet/slide
Pay only for files and directories used, no minimum fee or setup charge
Durable and high availability, replicate in different AZ in a region

#### Storage Gateway Service:
This service connects S3 to on premise data-center
Its a image that can connect with the S3.


### Databases Services

#### RDS <Relational Database Storage>: Important

#### Elastic Cache <Caching Storage>:
Allow fast data retrieval through data stored in memory caches, its in memory data cache system
E.g. If user is interested in top 10 items in a store, it can get the result directly from cache.
Can help to improve performance of read heavy applications as  it reduce latency in returning results.
It will take care of persistence itself
Use following open source engines - Memcached / Redis for task
Redis: Good to store data which is structured with common use cases as  - Leaderboards, Counting, Tracking, session management. Redis vs Memcached: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10558465/memcached-vs-redis
