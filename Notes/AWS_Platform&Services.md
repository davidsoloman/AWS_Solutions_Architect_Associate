## AWS: Platform & Services
AWS cloud platform can be categorized broadly into three main models for cloud computing:
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): It provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space.
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): It helps organizations to be more efficient as they don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running their application.
3. Software as a Service (SaaS): It provide a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. User do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how user will use that particular piece software.

All the services offered by AWS fall in one of the above categories. Below are are set of different services that are provided by AWS:


### A. Infrastructure Services
AWS infrastructure is split into Regions and Availability Zones

Regions(R): A geographic area where AWS resources exist, currently 15. Each R contains 2 or more AZ and these AZ provide the services

Availability Zones(AZ): A physical data center, nearly 35

Edge Location: A content delivery network, that can be used to cache the data/content for user. It is the CDN endpoint for AWS Cloudfront. There are nearly 66 Edge Location

#### VPC 
- It is a virtual Data Center in all the regions, multiple VPC / region.
- Note: Very Important topic for Associate certifications

#### Route 53  
- Amazon DNS service, Route + 53 
- here 53 is DNS port and route is after route 66

#### Cloud Front 
Caching and CDN service for large files and media services

#### Direct Connect 
Dedicated line connection, this service is not used to reduce reliability on Internet

#### EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) 
- This is virtual machine on AWS, provide compute resources
- EC2 Container Service (ECS) - Its basically a docker instance

#### EBS (Elastic Bean Stalk) 
- This is used to deploy and manage applications and code to AWS. 
- EBS will review the application and automatically detect deployment requirements, autoscaling, load balancing, health monitoring.
- Use other services such as EC2, S3, ELB, Autoscaling to deliver highly reliable, scalable and cost-effective infrastructure
- AWS cloud watch can be used to monitor the status and health and requirements of the application.

#### Lambda
- Allow to run application without need of a Server.
- The code is run whenever there is new data, or a new trigger for code. no charges for ideal time
- Good for real time data processing, mobile or Web apps
- Benefits: No server to manage or maintain, pay per use, no charge for idle time
- Trigger for Lambda can be generated by either kinesis, S3, Simple Notification Service, DynamoDB to trigger Lambda operation. This is due to any incoming load or change in the state
- Charging - Every 100ms code runs, or every trigger for the code.

#### Light sail

### Storage Services
Storage services are a critical component of cloud computing, holding the information used by applications. Big data analytics, data warehouses, Internet of Things, databases, and backup and archive applications all rely on some form of data storage architecture. Cloud storage is typically more reliable, scalable, and secure than traditional on-premises storage system. Storage serviecs has 4 components - 

#### S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- Used to store objects on cloud
- Include logs, csv, txt, json and other flat files.
- Most widely used storage service

#### Glacier
- Most widely used storage for archiving, offloads file from S3 to store for long term.
